You are too good for random local colleges (where no companies visit), but you might have missed the cutoff for top-tier NITs/IIITs (unless you have a great JEE score). The Scholarship Win: At LPU, your 80% is an asset. It likely qualifies you for a Category II or III Scholarship (depending on the current cutoff).",

Also not ignoring that the online education has bought much ease for teachers and students but on other side it has made studnets a bit lazy and unattentive towards their studies. Also the remote areas lack of infrastructure has proven a great challenge for children who are in villages and also living in town. So yes not probably a good thing for Indian Higher Education. You cannot do practices sitting on laptop which needs a proper lab and appraturs like the engineer students the architecture and design students."

That way you can much better relate with the course, and things make slightly more sense. However, if you are not much inclined towards technical work, then getting into MBA course directly after B.Tech."
